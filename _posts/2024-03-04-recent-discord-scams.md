**Discord Scam Exposed: Unveiling the Electron Injector Threat**

In recent times, a new scam has emerged within the Discord community, preying on unsuspecting users with the lure of trying out a new game. However, beneath the mask of innocent gaming lies a malicious plot: the deployment of an Electron injector masquerading as a game client. This injector not only wreaks havoc by crashing Discord but also sets up a nefarious webhook link, extracting sensitive user information for further exploitation.

**Investigative Pursuit: Unraveling the Mystery**

Determined to uncover the intricacies of this scam, my colleague Yavor and I went journey of reverse engineering the JavaScript (JS) code used by the perpetrators. However, our efforts were met with many roadblocks as the malicious actors had gone to great lengths to obfuscate the code, rendering it virtually unreadable. Despite our persistent attempts at decryption, we stumbled upon a weird revelation: a government/NASA moon mapping mission page, devoid of any discernible user interface. Curiously, the page contained cryptic coordinates, project names, and launch site/dates, hinting at a deeper connection to the origins of the scam. Alas, our investigation reached an end as the unreadable JS code would have taken too much time to decode.

**Combatting the Threat: A Call to Action for Discord**

In light of the escalating menace posed by this Discord scam and similar malware, urgent action is warranted from Discord. To stem the tide of Electron injector threats, Discord should take decisive measures, including the outright blocking of Electron injections within its ecosystem. By preventing the execution of unauthorized code, Discord can effectively neutralize this newfound malware variant, safeguarding its user base from potential harm.

Furthermore, Discord should institute rigorous scanning and verification protocols for webhook tokens. This fundamental yet pivotal step can significantly mitigate the risk of webhook abuse, curbing unauthorized data harvesting and impeding the propagation of malware across the platform.

**A Resolute Conclusion: Empowering Discord for a Safer Future**

In conclusion, it is imperative for Discord to remain vigilant against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. By prioritizing user safety and implementing proactive security measures, Discord can fortify its platform against emerging risks and uphold its commitment to providing a secure online environment for millions of users worldwide.
